// this page used to contain code for showing feed/notification counts at the top of all HN pages
// but it was redundant given the button info, so it got removed.
// I'm leaving this file and content injection in place (for now) in case I want to re-implement a feature in the future that runs on all hn pages. 
// The permission removal, then readdition would disable the extension for everyone
